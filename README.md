# Problem Description

The primary tool for detection of pneumonia are x-ray images of the lung.
We are given a dataset comprised of lung x-ray images of patients with pneumonia and of health lungs, and our classification task is the detection of those patientssuffering from pneumonia vs. the healthy group

# Restriction

We will furthermore implement our own convolutional layer, our own dense layer, and our own pooling layer.
